<h1>Manchester Shape Modelling Tutorial</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
This tutorial demonstrates how to use several of the key tools in the msm library to build a shape model, display its modes and explore the distributions of shape parameters.<br>
It assumes that you are familiar with running tools on a command line, and that your system is set up so that it knows where the <tt>msm_*</tt> tools are (for instance, by setting your $PATH variable to include the directory with the binaries).<br>
The tutorial is in the directory <tt>msm_tutorial</tt>, and includes a sub-directory (<tt>points_80</tt>) which contains 50 face shape examples, each annotated with 80 points.<br>

You can run the commands below directly in the tutorial directory, but you might want to take a copy of it to avoid changing the original when you edit files.<br>
See also the <a href="../msm_overview.html">overview of msm tools</a>.

<h2>Building a shape model</h2>
To build a shape model from the available examples, use the following command (from within the <tt>msm_tutorial</tt> directory:

<tt><pre>
msm_build_shape_model -p build_shape_model.params
</pre></tt>

This will load in the 50 sets of points listed in the parameter file. Since a <tt>reflection_symmetry</tt> is defined it will generate an additional set of 50 examples by reflecting each original example (and renumbering the points as defined).<br>
Thus the model is built from 100 examples in total, and saved to the file <tt>face_80pts.msm</tt> (defined in the parameter file).<br>

If you have the <a href="http://uomqvxl.sourceforge.net">uomqvxl</a> tools available, then you can display the modes of the model using the command:

<tt><pre>
qmsm_shape_mode_viewer -s face_80pts.msm -c face_80pts.crvs
</pre></tt>

The <tt>face_80pts.crvs</tt> is a text file defining how curves should be drawn through the points.
<h3>Activity</h3>
<ul>
<li>Copy <tt>face_80pts.crvs</tt> to <tt>face_80pts-b.crvs</tt>
<li>Edit <tt>face_80pts-b.crvs</tt> to add an additional line between points 0 and 14
<li>Display the result using qmsm_shape_mode_viewer
</ul>

<h2>Drawing the shape modes</h2>
We can generate EPS files showing the modes, which are better for including into papers (they use vector graphics so can be displayed at arbitrary resolutions).

Run:
<tt><pre>
msm_draw_shape_modes -p draw_shape_modes.params
</pre></tt>

This will generate three .eps files, which can be viewed with PDF viewers such as okular.<br>
To convert to PDF files, under Ubuntu, use:

<tt><pre>
ps2pdf face_80pts_s1.eps tmp.pdf
pdfcrop -clip tmp.pdf face_80pts_s1.pdf
</pre></tt>
The first command converts the eps to a PDF file, but fills a whole page.<br>
The second command creates a PDF cropped just to the area of interest, suitable for including in a document.<br>


<h3>Activity</h3>
Try editing the parameter file <tt>draw_shape_modes.params</tt> to change the appearance of the resulting plots:
<ul>
<li> Change the point size and colour
<li> Change the line-width
<li> Switch overlap_shapes to true
</ul>

<h2>Getting shape parameters</h3>
To get the shape parameters for each example, use the following:
<tt><pre>
msm_get_shape_params -p build_shape_model.params -o face_params.txt -u
</pre></tt>

This will read in all the shapes listed in <tt>build_shape_model.params</tt>, fit the shape model, then save the parameters to the named file, one line per shape.<br>
By default the first few numbers on each line are the parameters of the pose transformation.  So in this case (a similarity transformation), the first four are the pose, then columns 5 onwards are the shape parameters (the elements of the b-vector)<br>
To suppress the inclusion of the pose parameters you can add the <tt>-no_pose</tt> flag - in that case the first numbers will be the shape parameters.<br>

You can use your favourite plotting tool to display the scatter of the parameters.<br>
For instance, running <tt>gnuplot</tt>:
<tt><pre>
plot "face_params.txt" using 5:6
</pre></tt>
will create a scatter of the first shape parameter against the second.

<h3>Looking at histograms of the parameters</h3>
The tool can also create histograms for each parameter.<br>
Add flags to the call as follows:
<tt><pre>
msm_get_shape_params -p build_shape_model.params -o face_params.txt -u -h face_histo
</pre></tt>
The <tt>-h face_histo</tt> flag tells the tool to generate text files containing information describing histograms for each shape parameter, such as <tt>face_histo_b0.txt</tt> for the first parameter.<br>
This can be displayed using gnuplot with the command:
<tt><pre>
plot "face_histo_b0.txt" with boxes
</pre></tt>

<h2>Drawing shapes given parameters</h3>
The <tt>msm_draw_shapes</tt> tool can read in one or more sets of parameters from a text file and draw the resulting shape(s).<br>
For instance, run:
<tt><pre>
msm_draw_shapes -p draw_shapes.params -o face_80pts-egs.eps
</pre></tt>
This reads in a set of parameters for three shapes from the text file <tt>params_to_draw.txt</tt> (named in the <tt>draw_shapes.params</tt> file).
<tt>params_to_draw.txt</tt> looks like this:
<tt><pre>
-0.012 0.018 -0.019 0
0.057 -0.028 -0.008 0.001
-0.014 0.075  0.015 0
</pre></tt>
The tool saves the resulting EPS to the named file (<tt>face_80pts-egs.eps</tt>).

<h3>Activity</h3>
<ul>
<li>Edit <tt>params_to_draw.txt</tt> and examine the effect.
<li>Edit <tt>draw_shapes.params</tt> to change the colours etc
</ul>

<h2>Exploring the number of modes to use</h2>
One commonly decides how many modes to use either by specifying an upper limit (e.g. max_modes: 7) or by defining the proportion of the total variance to explain (e.g. var_prop: 95).<br>

The tool: <tt>msm_estimate_residuals</tt> can evaluate how well the shape model can approximate a given set of shapes using different numbers of modes, which can help when trying to decide a suitable number.

For example, try running:


<tt><pre>
msm_estimate_residuals -p build_shape_model.params -o residual_stats.txt
</pre></tt>

This will use leave-some-out experiments to evaluate the shape model's accuracy on unseen data as a function of the number of modes.<br>
Plot the second column (the mean approximation error) against the first (the number of modes).
For instance, in gnuplot use:
<tt><pre>
plot "residual_stats.txt" using 1:2:3 w errorbars
</pre></tt>
This shows the reduction in error (in image co-ordinates) as the number increases - enabling a choice of the number of modes to achieve a desired level of accuracy.<br>
Other columns in the output file give the approximation accuracy measured in the model reference frame.<br>
