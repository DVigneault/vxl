<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</h2>
A shape is represented as a set of points, stored in a msm_points
object, which encodes the co-ordinates in a vector (x0,y0,x1,y1,...).<br>

Shape is defined as that variation in geometry which is invariant
to some class of transformations.  Usually one considers
similarity transformations (scale, rotation and translation),
though others are also used.  To build a model from sets of shapes,
one first aligns the shapes to remove the effects of the global
transform.<br>

The alignment and representation of transformations
is encoded using the msm_aligner objects.<br>

The shape model itself is a linear model of the form
<pre>
  shape = mean + P*b
</pre>
where mean is the mean shape, P is a matrix of modes of variation
and b is a vector of shape parameters.


<h2><a name="data_formats">Data File Formats</h3>
Key data files encode sets of points (*.pts) and curves (*.crvs).

<h3><a name="points">msm_points: Points file</h3>
<p>All the tools assume that points are provided in text files in one of the two formats shown below.<br>
The <tt>msm_points</tt> class encodes a set of points which can be read from/written to a text file in the format shown below.</p>

This is the default format which is written by the tools and library functions:
<tt><pre>
version: 1
n_points: 3
{
316.069 201.255
410.593 206.549
333.881 320.539
}
</pre></tt>

Note that points in a simpler two column format can also be read in:
<tt><pre>
3
316.069 201.255
410.593 206.549
333.881 320.539
</pre></tt>
The first line indicates how many points follow.

<h3><a name="curves">msm_curves: Curves file</h3>
The <tt>msm_curves</tt> class encodes one or more "curves" as a set of point indices.<br>
Each curve is assumed to join the given points in the order supplied.<br>
If the curve is not open, then it is assumed to be closed and the last point is
connected to the first point.<br>
The <tt>crvs</tt> file is a text file defining the curves in a fairly easy to read/edit way.<br>
For example, <tt>face_68pts.crvs</tt> defines the curves on a 68 point face markup:<br>
<tt><pre>
curves: {
  curve:  { name: Chin open: true indices: { 0:14 } }
  curve:  { name: LEyebrow open: false indices: { 15:20 } }
  curve:  { name: REyebrow open: false indices: { 21:26 } }
  curve:  { name: LEye open: false indices: { 27:30 } }
  curve:  { name: REye open: false indices: { 32:35 } }
  curve:  { name: Nose open: true indices: { 37:45 } }
  curve:  { name: Nostrils open: true indices: { 46 47 } }
  curve:  { name: OuterLips open: false indices: { 48:59 } }
  curve:  { name: TopLip open: true indices: { 48 60 61 62 54 } }
  curve:  { name: BottomLip open: true indices: { 54 63 64 65 48 } }
}
</pre></tt>

The elements of each curve are:
<ul>
<li>name: The following text (which must not include any whitespace) defines a name for the curve
<li>open: true/false  - Defines whether the curve is open or closed
<li>indices: A list of integers defining the points to be connected. Ranges can be specified, such as 0:14 or 45:40 (for counting backwards) to indicate all integers in the given range.
</ul>

<h3><a name="file_structure">Organising Files</h3>
Generally a shape is defined by a set of points annotated on an image.<br>
For convenience we usually use similar names for points and image files, so that <tt>image7.pts</tt> will be the points annotated on <tt>image7.png</tt>.  This is not a strict requirement though.<br>
Usually we also arrange that all the images are in one directory (say "images") and all the points are in another (say "points"), leading to a file structure like this:<br>
<ul>
<li>images
  <ul>
  <li>image001.png
  <li>image002.png
  <li>image003.png
  <li>...
  </ul>
<li>points
  <ul>
  <li>image001.pts
  <li>image002.pts
  <li>image003.pts
  <li>...
  </ul>
<li>models
  <ul>
  <li>image_list.txt
  <li>face_68.crvs
  <li>build_shape_model.params
  <li>...
  </ul>
</ul>
The models directory contains parameter files for the various tools.<br>
The files to be used by any tool are stored in a standard format in an image_list text file.

<h3><a name="image_list">Image Lists</h3>
The image list file (e.g. <tt>image_list.txt</tt>) contains the paths to points and associated images in the following format:

<tt><pre>
// Directories containing data:
points_dir: ../points/
image_dir: ../images/

images:
{
  image001.pts : image001.png
  image002.pts : image002.png
  image003.pts : image003.png
  // ...
}
</pre></tt>
Comments can be added using "//" - anything after this on the line will be ignored (C++ style).

<h2><a name="building_shape">Building Shape Models</h2>
To build a shape model, from within the <tt>models</tt> directory run a command such as:
<tt><pre>
msm_build_shape_model -p build_shape_model.params
</pre></tt>

The parameter file should look something like this:
<tt><pre>
/: Aligner for shape model
aligner: msm_similarity_aligner

//: Define how to align mean shape in reference frame
// Options: { first_shape, mean_pose }
ref_pose_source: first_shape

//: Object to apply limits to parameters
param_limiter: msm_ellipsoid_limiter { accept_prop: 0.98 }

// Minimum number of shape modes
min_modes: 0

// Maximum number of shape modes
max_modes: 99

// Proportion of shape variation to explain
var_prop: 0.95

//: File to save model to
shape_model_path: shape_model.msm

image_dir: ../images/
points_dir: ../points/
images: {
  image1.pts : image1.jpg
  image2.pts : image2.jpg
  // ...
}
</pre></tt>

This will build a linear statistical shape model from the supplied examples (image1.pts etc) and save it to the named file (<tt>shape_model.msm</tt>)

The main choices to be made are
<ul>
<li>Type of aligner
<li>How to select the number of modes
<li>The way parameters will be limited when the model is fitted to new points
</ul>

<h3>msm_aligner : How to align shapes</h3>
Options include:
<ul>
<li> msm_translation_aligner  : Translation (tx,ty)
<li> msm_zoom_aligner         : Scale and translation (s,tx,ty)
<li> msm_rigid_aligner        : Rotation and translation (A,tx,ty)
<li> msm_similarity_aligner   : Scale, rotation and translation (a,b,tx,ty)
<li> msm_affine_aligner       : Six parameter affine transformations
<li> msm_subset_aligner       : Align using only a subset of the points
</ul>

The number of modes of the model is chosen to be in the range [min_modes,max_modes] such that
the variance explained by the chosen modes is at least a proportion var_prop of the total variance of the training data.
